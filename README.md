# Lillip

Lillip is a web application that provides a detailed recommendation plan for users to improve their cholesterol levels and their overall health. Users are asked a series of questions regarding their current cholesterol levels from their lipid panel test, as well as their dietary, exercise, and other health habits (medications and/or smoking). The recommendation plan is then determined based on these results.
